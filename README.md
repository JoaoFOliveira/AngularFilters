AngularJS Filters
==========

A bunch of utility filters i found useful on a couple of projects. Only generic ones published for obvious reasons.

* Most of the filters are used to parse date/time values and require [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/)  
* Credits also to teammates working on the same projects
